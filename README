Game Prototype for Game Design class at Rutgers University

The idea for this was to create a puzzle game based on light/lasers. Rather than doing that I tried it with shooting a ball and you have to reflect it into an enemy. 

Controls:
Left Click - Drag and Let go to create a mirror.
Right Click - Create a small short vortex that will pull the ball to your cursor.

d - Turn off the arrow that will tell you where the next ball will go. Makes the game harder.

q - The next shot will be a multiball shot. First shoots 2 "preview" balls that will tell you where the balls will shoot. Then, you set up your mirrors and it shoots the real bullets.


Objective:
Kill all the red things. The middle shooter will shoot the bullets and you must draw mirrors to reflect the balls to the enemy. When a ball hits a mirror it breaks it. You have a limited amount of mirrors that can be active at a time. You lose a life if a ball leaves the screen.


Written in LWJGL and Box2D.

This code is by far the worst thing written in the world cause its a prototype.
Please don't look at what I do to delete from an ArrayList! I honestly don't know what I was thinking at 5AM in the morning -_-
